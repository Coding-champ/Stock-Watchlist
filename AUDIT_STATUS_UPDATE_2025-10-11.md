## ✅ COMPLETED ITEMS

### 1. ✅ yFinance Service Modularization (COMPLETED - Oct 11, 2025)

**Original Issue:** Monolithic `yfinance_service.py` (~1.1k LOC) combined multiple responsibilities

**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETED**

**Implementation:**
```
backend/app/services/yfinance/
├── __init__.py           ✅ Re-exports for backward compatibility
├── client.py             ✅ Core utilities & base classes
├── stock_info.py         ✅ Stock information fetching
├── price_data.py         ✅ Price history & chart data
├── financial_data.py     ✅ Dividends, splits, earnings
└── indicators.py         ✅ Technical indicators
```

**Benefits Achieved:**
- Clear separation of concerns
- Each module has single responsibility
- Backward compatibility maintained via `__init__.py`
- Easier to test individual components
- Reduced merge conflicts

**Files Modified:**
- Created: `backend/app/services/yfinance/` package with 6 modules
- Maintained: `backend/app/services/yfinance_service.py` as compatibility wrapper

---

### 2. ✅ ChartDataService Extracted (COMPLETED - Oct 11, 2025)

**Original Issue:** Routes performing heavy lifting for chart data

**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETED**

**Implementation:**
- Created `backend/app/services/chart_data_service.py`
- Encapsulates chart query logic
- Handles caching decisions
- Used in `backend/app/routes/stock_data.py`

**Benefits:**
- Routes are now thin controllers
- Logic reusable outside HTTP context
- Easier to test chart functionality
- Consistent error handling

---

### 3. ✅ Chart Data Period Filtering (COMPLETED - Oct 11, 2025)

**New Issue Discovered:** Charts displayed wrong time periods (3y showed 10y data)

**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETED**

**Root Cause:**
- `_get_extended_period()` loaded too much data (3y → 10y)
- No filtering back to requested period after indicator calculation
- Indicators calculated over entire extended dataset

**Solution Implemented:**
1. **Optimized `_get_extended_period()`:**
   - 3y now loads 7y (instead of 10y) for SMA200 warmup
   - 1y loads 3y (better SMA200 coverage)
   - More balanced approach across all periods

2. **Added Period Filtering:**
   - New function: `_calculate_period_cutoff_date()` 
   - Calculates correct start date for display period
   - Filters data after indicator calculation

3. **Added Indicator Filtering:**
   - New function: `_filter_indicators_by_dates()`
   - Aligns indicators with displayed date range
   - Handles both simple and complex indicators (MACD, Bollinger)

**Files Modified:**
- `backend/app/services/yfinance/client.py`
- `backend/app/services/yfinance/price_data.py`

**Test Results:**
```
3Y Chart: 1092 days (~3.0 years) ✅
1Y Chart: 365 days (~1.0 years) ✅
SMA50 valid: 100% ✅
SMA200 valid: 100% ✅
```

## ⏳ IN PROGRESS / PARTIALLY COMPLETED

### 4. ⏳ Fast_info Migration (PARTIALLY COMPLETED)

**Original Issue:** Excessive use of slow `ticker.info` property (3-5s per call)

**Status:** ⏳ **PARTIALLY COMPLETED**

**What's Done:**
- `get_fast_stock_data()` uses `fast_info` ✅
- `get_extended_stock_data()` uses `fast_info` for basic data ✅
- Performance optimized in several endpoints ✅

**Still TODO:**
- [ ] Audit all remaining `.info` usages
- [ ] Replace in `alert_service.py`
- [ ] Replace in remaining services
- [ ] Add performance monitoring

**Impact:** Some endpoints still slow due to `.info` usage

---

### 5. ⏳ RSI Calculation Consolidation (IN PROGRESS)

**Original Issue:** 5+ duplicate RSI implementations across codebase

**Status:** ⏳ **IN PROGRESS**

**Canonical Implementation:**
- ✅ `backend/app/services/technical_indicators_service.py` (THE SOURCE OF TRUTH)

**Duplicates Still Present:**
- ⚠️ `backend/app/services/yfinance/indicators.py` - Imports from canonical (GOOD)
- ⚠️ `backend/app/services/alert_service.py` - May still have duplicate
- ⚠️ Frontend `StockChartModal.js` - JavaScript implementation still present
- ⚠️ `yfinance_examples.py` - Example code (low priority)

**TODO:**
- [ ] Audit all RSI calculations
- [ ] Ensure all backend code uses `technical_indicators_service.py`
- [ ] Remove/update frontend calculation (fetch from API instead)
- [ ] Document canonical implementation

---

## ❌ NOT YET STARTED

### 6. 🔴 CRITICAL: CORS Configuration (NOT STARTED)

**Issue:** Open CORS policy is a security vulnerability

**Current State:**
```python
# backend/app/main.py
app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=["*"],  # ⚠️ SECURITY RISK
    allow_credentials=True,  # ⚠️ DANGEROUS
)
```

**CVSS Score:** 8.6 (HIGH)

**TODO:**
- [ ] Change to specific origins
- [ ] Use environment variables for configuration
- [ ] Test in development and production
- [ ] Document required env vars

**Estimated Time:** 2 hours

**Priority:** 🔴 CRITICAL

---

### 7. 🔴 HIGH: Authentication/Authorization (NOT STARTED)

**Issue:** No authentication system, all endpoints public

**Current State:** All CRUD operations accessible without auth

**TODO:**
- [ ] Phase 1: Add API key authentication
- [ ] Add middleware for API key validation
- [ ] Secure sensitive endpoints
- [ ] Phase 2 (future): OAuth2/JWT for multi-user

**Estimated Time:** 24 hours

**Priority:** 🔴 HIGH (if multi-user planned)

---

### 8. 🟡 MEDIUM: Frontend Component Splitting (NOT STARTED)

**Issue:** Components too large, violate single responsibility

**Problem Files:**
- `StockChart.js` - 2003 lines 🔴
- `StockTable.js` - 985 lines 🟡

**TODO:**
- [ ] Split StockChart into:
  - ChartCanvas.js
  - ChartControls.js
  - ChartIndicators.js
  - FibonacciOverlay.js
  - Custom hooks (useChartData, useIndicators)
  
- [ ] Split StockTable into smaller components
- [ ] Extract reusable hooks
- [ ] Improve component testability

**Estimated Time:** 16-24 hours

**Priority:** 🟡 MEDIUM

---

### 9. 🟡 MEDIUM: Frontend Testing (NOT STARTED)

**Issue:** No automated frontend tests

**Current State:** 
- 25 backend test files ✅
- 0 frontend test files ❌

**TODO:**
- [ ] Install React Testing Library
- [ ] Write component tests for:
  - StockTable
  - StockChart
  - WatchlistSection
  - AlertDashboard
- [ ] Set up Jest configuration
- [ ] Add to CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Target 60% coverage

**Estimated Time:** 24 hours

**Priority:** 🟡 MEDIUM

---

### 10. 🟡 MEDIUM: Rate Limiting (NOT STARTED)

**Issue:** No protection against yfinance API abuse

**TODO:**
- [ ] Implement YFinanceGateway with rate limiting
- [ ] Add exponential backoff for failed requests
- [ ] Track request counts per ticker
- [ ] Add server-side throttling
- [ ] Monitor yfinance API usage

**Estimated Time:** 8 hours

**Priority:** 🟡 MEDIUM

---

### 11. 🟢 LOW: Database Query Optimization (NOT STARTED)

**Issue:** Potential N+1 queries, missing indexes

**TODO:**
- [ ] Audit all database queries
- [ ] Add eager loading where appropriate
- [ ] Create compound indexes for common queries
- [ ] Run EXPLAIN ANALYZE on slow queries
- [ ] Add query performance monitoring

**Estimated Time:** 12 hours

**Priority:** 🟢 LOW

---

### 12. 🟢 LOW: Redis Caching (NOT STARTED)

**Issue:** Current caching uses database (not optimal for scale)

**Current State:** Database-backed cache works but not ideal for production scale

**TODO:**
- [ ] Set up Redis
- [ ] Implement RedisCache adapter
- [ ] Migrate from DB cache to Redis
- [ ] Configure TTLs appropriately
- [ ] Add cache monitoring

**Estimated Time:** 16 hours

**Priority:** 🟢 LOW (only needed at scale)

## 📝 Notes

### Architecture Improvements
The recent modularization work has significantly improved the architecture:
- Clear boundaries between modules
- Single responsibility principle better adhered to
- Dependency injection patterns emerging
- Service layer properly separated from HTTP layer

### Testing Strategy
With modularization complete, testing becomes easier:
- Each yfinance module can be tested independently
- Mocking is simpler with clear interfaces
- Integration tests can focus on module interactions

### Performance Gains
The chart period filtering fix provides immediate benefits:
- Reduced data transfer (3y no longer sends 10y data)
- Faster indicator calculations (smaller datasets)
- Better user experience (correct time periods)
