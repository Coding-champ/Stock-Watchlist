- Updated Prerequisites to include Node.js
- Updated Setup instructions with frontend build steps
- Added Development Mode section explaining hot reload
- Updated project structure diagram

#### Modified `ARCHITECTURE.md`
- Updated System Architecture diagram to reflect React frontend

### 4. Configuration Updates

#### Modified `.gitignore`
- Added React/Node specific ignores:
  - `frontend/node_modules/`
  - `frontend/build/`
  - `frontend/.env.local`
  - `frontend/npm-debug.log*`
  - etc.

#### Modified `start.sh`
- Updated URL from `http://localhost:8000/static/index.html` to `http://localhost:8000/`

## Features Preserved

All features from the original application have been preserved in the React version:

1. ✅ Watchlist Management (Create, View)
2. ✅ Stock Management (Add, View, Delete, Move)
3. ✅ Search & Filter by name, ISIN, ticker
4. ✅ Sortable columns
5. ✅ Stock detail view with alerts
6. ✅ Responsive design
7. ✅ German language interface

## Component Architecture

```
App.js (Main)
├── WatchlistSection
│   └── Modal (Create Watchlist)
└── StocksSection (if watchlist selected)
    ├── StockTable
    ├── StockModal (Add Stock)
    └── StockDetailModal (View Details)
```

## Benefits of React Migration

1. **Component Reusability** - Components can be reused and tested independently
2. **State Management** - React hooks provide better state management
3. **Developer Experience** - Hot reload during development
4. **Maintainability** - Cleaner code organization
5. **Scalability** - Easier to add new features
6. **Tooling** - Better debugging and development tools

## How to Use

### For Production Deployment

1. Build the frontend:
   ```bash
   ./build-frontend.sh
   ```

2. Start the backend:
   ```bash
   uvicorn backend.app.main:app --reload
   ```

3. Access at: http://localhost:8000/

### For Development

1. Start backend (terminal 1):
   ```bash
   uvicorn backend.app.main:app --reload
   ```

2. Start React dev server (terminal 2):
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```

3. Access at: http://localhost:3000/

## Migration Notes

- The React version uses the same API endpoints as before
- All business logic remains in the backend
